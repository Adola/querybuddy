# querybuddy
a generic library for gathering DOM elements

This package was created as an alternative to writing document.querySelector, document.getElementById, etc in your javascript code.
The intent is to replace the decision of choosing between getElementById, and querySelector with a decision of needing 1 element or 
more than 1 element.

If you have suggestions feel free to fork this or send me an email!
